# PUBG-Tracker-Android
Android application built using a MVC architecture, using the offical Player Unknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) API to manage player and match stats.

## Introduction
This application was built as a small personal project to track the stats for a group of friends who played Player Unknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG)
together on a regular occasion. The app is currently hardcoded to the four players who originally made use of it, however it was designed
such that these players could be swapped out for others, or expanded upon. 

## App Sections
The app contains four sections:
* **Player Stats** - Tracking individual statistics for a given player across one season of PUBG 
* **Match Stats** - Provides individual statistics for each match, for a given player in the one season of PUBG
* **WXC Stats** - Generates awards and group stats for when all four players played together on the same day
* **Leaderboard** - Provides a leaderboard for all players in the current season, with colour coding
